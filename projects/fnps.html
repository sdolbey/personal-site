                                The Florida Native Plant Society (FNPS) is a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving Florida's remaining natural places and conserving the plants that call them home. <strong>Their website hosts an extensive database of Florida's native plants and serves as an excellent resource for gardeners and landscapers looking to add some native plants to their projects.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This was a personal project. I was teaching myself Figma and needed a project I could really sink my teeth into—something that would force me to interact with as many of Figma's features as possible. FNPS didn't ask me to do this. I consider it my way of giving back for all I've learned from them and the work that they do.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>After sending this to FNPS, they liked what they saw. We're currently in the early stages of a real, long-term redesign of their website. While this started as a personal project, it may lead to something greater.</strong>

                                Landscaping Favorites have been elevated from a footnote to the stars of the show. A toggle switch above sort and filter hides the rest of the plants so <strong>landscaping-oriented visitors can focus on just the plants they're most likely to be able to find and grow.</strong> This makes it easier for visitors to find actionable recommendations and helps FNPS by getting more ecosystem-supporting native plants in the ground instead of non-native contractor specials from Lowe's.

                                After exploring different layouts for the plant database and plant profiles, I turned my attention to the content. The plant profiles had lots of information about each plant, but the arrangement wasn't ideal. <strong>I took all the data points from the plant profiles and used an open card sort</strong> with a few users to see how they would group them. Though the sample size was small, <strong>there was strong consensus among users</strong>, so I was still able to get some useful insights out of it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Running statistical analysis on the results revealed three main groups of information, which I labeled Site Conditions, Ecology, and Plant Specs. <strong>Within the larger ecology-focused grouping, an interesting subgrouping emerged.</strong> All participants grouped: how to use it, where it grows, and where to get it. <strong>This led to a new, more actionable section on the plant profile called “Grow this plant” that attempts to answer the question, “Is this the right plant for me?”</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I used the card sort results to help me rearrange the rest of the plant profile as well as the list of filters for the plant database.

                                There were so many ideas I had for how to enrich the entries of the plant database that had to be scrapped. I started with sunlight requirements and what wildlife the plant attracted; notable features from the profiles like “showy flowers” sounded good, too. At one point, I was even making custom icons for the animals because the ones FNPS already had were a bit too detailed for smaller sizes. But putting all these things on the list entries just added clutter.

                                At one point, in my effort to elevate them, Landscaping Favorites were going to be a lane of cards above the rest of the plants. There are 156 landscaping favorites in the database. Imagine scrolling through that — <em>horizontally</em> — on a phone. And if that wasn't bad enough, some of the scientific plant names have subspecies so the whole thing is like a run-on sentence. They really needed their own line and as much width as the screen would allow. Narrow cards were out. Grids were out. Lists! Lists are good!

                                <strong>I also learned to really appreciate research — not just for the insights, but more so the peace of mind it provides.</strong> When I was unsure of how to order the filters, for example, I could lean on my plant profile card sort results (which contains largely the same categories). <strong>Instead of hemming and hawing over what should go where, I could just look at my data and be done and stop worrying about it. My only regret was not doing the research sooner.</strong>
