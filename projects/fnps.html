                                The plant profiles had lots of information about each plant, but the arrangement wasn't ideal. <strong>I took all the data points from the plant profiles and used an open card sort</strong> with a few users to see how they would group them. Though the sample size was small, <strong>there was strong consensus among users</strong>, so I was still able to get some useful insights out of it.

                                Running statistical analysis on the results revealed three main groups of information, which I labeled Site Conditions, Ecology, and Plant Specs. <strong>Within the larger ecology-focused grouping, an interesting subgrouping emerged.</strong> All participants grouped: how to use it, where it grows, and where to get it. <strong>This led to a new, more actionable section on the plant profile called “Grow this plant” that attempts to answer the question, “Is this the right plant for me?”</strong>

                                Landscaping Favorites have been elevated from a footnote to the stars of the show. A toggle switch above sort and filter hides the rest of the plants so <strong>landscaping-oriented visitors can focus on just the plants they're most likely to be able to find and grow.</strong> This makes it easier for visitors to find actionable recommendations and helps FNPS by getting more ecosystem-supporting native plants in the ground instead of non-native contractor specials from Lowe's.

                                The original website used the Roboto typeface and Material Design 1 aesthetics. At first, I only used the new Material components library to speed up prototyping in Figma, but I liked how it was coming together, and FNPS liked the new look, so it seems to have stuck for now.

                                Corben (for headings) and Karla (body text) have similar bones and pair beautifully. Sans serif typefaces like Karla work well for smaller text on websites since they render well even on low-pixel density screens.

                                There were so many ideas I had for how to enrich the entries of the plant database that had to be scrapped. I started with sunlight requirements and what wildlife the plant attracted; notable features from the profiles like “showy flowers” sounded good, too. At one point, I was even making custom icons for the animals because the ones FNPS already had were a bit too detailed for smaller sizes. But putting all these things on the list entries just added clutter.

                                At one point, in my effort to elevate them, Landscaping Favorites were going to be a lane of cards above the rest of the plants. There are 156 landscaping favorites in the database. Imagine scrolling through that — <em>horizontally</em> — on a phone. And if that wasn't bad enough, some of the scientific plant names have subspecies so the whole thing is like a run-on sentence. They really needed their own line and as much width as the screen would allow. Narrow cards were out. Grids were out. Lists were in!

                                <strong>I also learned to really appreciate research — not just for the insights, but more so the peace of mind it provides.</strong> When I was unsure of how to order the filters, for example, I could lean on my plant profile card sort results (which contains largely the same categories). <strong>Instead of hemming and hawing over what should go where, I could just look at my data and be done and stop worrying about it. My only regret was not doing that research sooner.</strong>

                                This project is ongoing and began with limited research. The dev team is still figuring out what stack to use for the broader modernization effort of FNPS.org, so <strong>before development begins in earnest, I want to go back and do more research with users to make sure we're on the right track and addressing all potential issues.</strong>

                                This portion of the project focused on the plant database, but the second most visited section of the website is the newsletter and magazine archive, which I haven't even touched yet. There is much to do!

                                <strong>FNPS has no client-side analytics in place on the existing website. All I have to work with is server-side stats (mostly just page view counts), so I have some data blindspots. I'm pushing for something more comprehensive so I can watch user sessions to see how people typically interact with the plant list. I need that context to be able to predict how a successful redesign will impact metrics.</strong> Does the lack of context about each plant make people click on more plants because they have to, or fewer because they don't know where to start?

                                While I'm confident that what I've done is a net improvement over the existing website, these designs have yet to be validated with users, so that's on the agenda, as well.
