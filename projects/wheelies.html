                            It can be hard to know which places are fully accessible or even where the accessible entrance is. Our goal was to design an app that was attractive and easy to use and didn’t rely entirely on users to fill out the map.

Businesses and local governments are also part of the process. Businesses would be able to self-report what accommodations they provide, which users would then judge for accuracy. Local governments would be able to access ADA violation reports and take action against businesses that fail to accommodate all people.

                        <p>
                            Time and availability constraints ensured we would never move past the design phase for this project. It never got built, but we weren’t expected to. The assignment was to design something using user-centered design principles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If it had been built, I suspect we would have run into the same problem as other apps in this space: not enough users to reach critical mass of accessibility reviews. We could avoid the small database of places by using Google or some other mapping service as a base, but user reviews would still be a trickle compared to what we need to make the app worthwhile.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It can be hard to know which places are fully accessible or even where the accessible entrance is. A member of our team, Simon, knows this struggle intimately. Looking at existing apps that attempt to solve this problem, few had good interfaces or extensive databases. Most relied too heavily on input from a tiny userbase to fill out a massive world of businesses and venues. Our goal was to design an app that was attractive and easy to use and didn’t rely entirely on users to fill out the map.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our solution was basically Google Maps but focused on accessibility. A familiar interface, but with the information our users care about front and center. Some of the goals we defined for ourselves (should this product go to market) were to help at least one person with mobility issues, help at least one business be more accessible, and to beat time-on-task results of similar apps.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of our ideas to combat the issue of lack of ratings was to encourage businesses to add their own ratings, which would then be verified by users. Businesses found to be lying or in violation of ADA guidelines could be reported via the app.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For the interface, I went from information architecture straight to a simple prototype in Adobe XD. Normally, I would sketch it out first, but I had a very clear vision of how I wanted it to look, so I didn’t feel the need this time. At this stage, we didn’t have any branding or style guidelines. It was just a barebones layout with stock Android light theme colors. The focus was on structure.

                        <p>
                            For testing, Stephen initially performed a user task analysis using the think aloud protocol with a similar app, Wheelguide, available on both iOS and Android. He asked the user to create an account, find a Publix grocery store, and review its accessibility. The user found the onboarding process and search to be a little clunky but was able to find a Publix and review it. She wished there was a map view for search results to better judge distance from her current location but thought the accessibility review process was well-done. Wheelguide was one of the better apps we found during our market research, so this was the standard we were up against.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next round of testing was done by Matt with my prototype. The goal was, again, to find a Publix. The user thought it was well-designed, but initially had trouble finding the search bar and suggested the option to move it to the top. I chose to put it at the bottom of the screen, above the bottom navigation tabs, because it would be easier to reach. However, this placement subverted user expectations and caused initial confusion. Future iterations would have the search bar at the top, where it is in Google Maps.
                        </p>
                        <figure class="full-bleed">

                        </figure>
                        <p>
                            For branding, Yoandy whipped up some quick experimental designs using the original prototype and I pulled elements of the most popular one into the final prototype, which saw the addition of a simple settings page and review submission page. Around this time, Simon also put together our style guide.

                            A final user task analysis was performed by Matt. The user was asked to find a Publix, like before, and also find the bookmarks page. There was a little confusion with the bookmarks when the user clicked the button to save that location rather than the tab at the bottom, but otherwise, the user had little difficulty navigating the prototype and liked the design.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall, our design was focused and effective, if a little derivative, but that was on purpose. Getting user feedback was incredibly valuable during this project. It helped me realize that just because a design choice makes sense, doesn’t mean it’ll be immediately intuitive for users.

                            I’m mostly happy with how the project turned out. The design was clean and users found it easy to navigate. Unfortunately, the final stretch of this project was during quarantine due to COVID-19, and motivation among the team was at an all-time low. I would have liked to flesh out the final prototype a bit more – add visuals and names to the categories on the explore and bookmarks tabs, for example. The final prototype gets the idea across, but it’s a little underwhelming, visually.
