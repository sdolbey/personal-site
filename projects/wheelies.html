                            We surveyed potential users and found that many of them have had past experiences of being unable to find an entrance they could use. <strong>One respondent mentioned going in circles around a building looking for an accessible entrance before.</strong> Respondents were also excited by the idea of reporting businesses in violation of ADA rules for entrances. When it comes to how they locate accessible entrances now, respondents were split between checking pictures on something like Google Maps or simply showing up and hoping for the best. When asked how knowing where accessible entrances are in advance would help them, respondents said it would help them be on-time for appointments and special events.

                            <strong>We analyzed 15 existing apps that serve the same niche. We found that, generally, these apps have strong regional biases. They rely on crowdsourced data, which results in a regional feedback loop.</strong> Areas that already have some usable data will maintain and build a userbase, while other areas will fail to see adoption or opt for a competing app. Some apps even have language barriers due to incomplete localization. Wheelies would likely suffer from the same regional feedback loops. Some apps, like Accessible Dispatch NYC, realized this limitation and focused on a specific market.

                        <p>
                            Most competing apps offer some kind of sorting and filtering of locations by category, proximity, and accessibility. Two thirds of them include contact information so users can call the business to verify accessibility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>However, less than half of competing apps allow photographing entrances or reporting inaccessible entrances.</strong> These were features that aligned with what our survey respondents mentioned using or being excited about.

                            A teammate ran a user task analysis using the think aloud protocol with Wheelguide. In our earlier analysis, Wheelguide had a generally polished interface, though it was unique among the 15 apps we looked at in that it didn't have a map view for finding places.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The user was asked to create an account, find a Publix grocery store and review its accessibility. She found the onboarding process to be a little clunky and the icon-based search filters were too ambiguous for her, but she was able to find the nearest Publix with a text search. She lamented the lack of a map view in search results to better judge distance from her current location. Tapping the store opened a bottom sheet with an accessibility report card rather than the store's profile, which initially confused her. The review process went smoothly, and she liked the color coding and happy face/sad face rating system.

                            <strong>Most apps in this niche have small, often regional databases. One idea we had to alleviate this was to ask businesses to self-report.</strong> This data would need to be verified by users, but it would still be <em>something</em> where competing apps often have <em>nothing</em>.

                            I started with a three-tab bottom app bar and a search bar. There was a Map tab, Explore tab (browse places by category), and Bookmarks tab (where users could browse their saved places). <strong>In the age of ever bigger phones, I opted to anchor the search bar to the bottom of the screen to make it easier to reach with one hand.</strong>

                        <p>
                            Another member of the team tested our prototype with a new user. The goal, as with our testing with Wheelguide, was to find a nearby Publix grocery store.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>The user liked the design, but initially had trouble finding the search bar and suggested the option to move it to the top. I had placed it at the bottom with good intentions, but this search bar placement subverted user expectations and made the app less intuitive and familiar.</strong> Future iterations would have the search bar at the top, where it is in Google Maps. Other than the search bar placement, the user had no trouble completing their task.

                            One of our designers whipped up some quick experimental designs using the original prototype, and I pulled elements of the most popular one into the next iteration. I also added a simple settings page and review submission screen.

                            A final user task analysis was performed with the more colorful prototype. The user was asked to find a Publix and check its accessibility rating. That went smoothly, and <strong>accessing the search screen was faster than previous iterations.</strong>

                            This is where things left off. Overall, our design was focused and effective. Validating our designs with user testing was incredibly valuable during this project. Relocating the search bar to a spot people can reach makes sense, but we still need to check our assumptions with testing, and the testing showed that meeting user expectations may be more important than ergonomics, at least at first.

                            When we completed this project in school, I was satisfied with what we had done and what I had learned, but I knew there were areas in the prototype where I didn't do enough. The Explore and Bookmarks tabs, for example, were just orange rectangles with placeholder text. I wanted to go back and flesh things out and include things that we had talked about but never showed. <strong>This project had a lot of research put into it, and I wanted to honor that effort by building a prototype to be proud of.</strong>

                        <p>
                            The original prototype had a very barebones representation of what a location's profile page might look like. It had a picture, title, category, address, phone number, operating hours, and accessibility rating. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Early in the project, much of the focus was specifically on helping people find accessible entrances.</strong> We had also discussed including user comments so folks could give others a heads up for anything that might give them trouble. Neither of these features were properly demonstrated in the prototypes. These oversights have been addressed. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Now, there's a satellite map with a pin over the main entrance, plus a row of user photos from ground level.</strong> I also fleshed out the accessibility rating details, which now includes a checklist of the features from the review process. A comments section follows with notes from reviewers, which users can mark as helpful.

                            The top bar also gets a less ambiguous bookmark button and no longer coexists with the bottom navigation bar, which had a similar icon for the Bookmarks screen. This was a minor source of confusion in user testing. When a place hasn't been bookmarked, it has a little plus sign at the top right corner. When a place has been bookmarked, it changes to a small checkmark.

                            The review process now has more of a focus on the main entrance. Users are asked to confirm the point on the map where the door can be found and to rate whether the entrance is easy to find, has powered doors, and is wheelchair accessible. The other ratings have also been expanded upon with more descriptive titles and help text. Taking a cue from Wheelguide, the “accessible interior” rating has been split into “space for internal circulation” and “low counters/tables”. Finally, there's an optional section for comments so folks can add details they think others would like to know before they go.

                            Unlike Google Maps, Wheelies wouldn't have a user's location history to tailor business suggestions, so I opted to use current location to surface nearby places that have recently received accessibility reviews, as well as local places with highly positive ratings. These sit in their own horizontally scrolling lanes, and the list of categories follows.

The top of the screen features the user's contributions so far, such as the number of reviews they've posted or the number of likes their comments have received.

Once the user visits those places, they can quickly rate the comments that were helpful and tap into the profile to review the location's accessibility. Another section asks users to add entrance photos for places that don't have any.

                            This was fun to come back to. I could have left things as they were. It was good enough for the class. I think we got a 100% in the end, since the project was far more about the design process rather than the outcome. However, I didn't want to put myself in the position of presenting this project in an interview and getting to the Explore or Bookmarks tabs and being like, “Ta-da! Here's the part where I didn't even bother!”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I care about the quality of my work. My portfolio is meant to be a showcase of how I approach a problem and what I can do, and the work we turned in at the end of the semester during a plague wasn't a great reflection of that.
