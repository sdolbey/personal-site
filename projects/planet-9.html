                            The project required us to make an advocacy website, and the topic was up to us. A few topics came up, from climate change to stopping deer from being hit by cars and, finally, suggested as a joke, making Pluto a planet again. The funny little rock at the edge of the solar system got the nod. We decided that a petition might make a good call to action, and so, things were set in motion.

                        <p>
                            This project was a bit lighthearted, but we still had a real audience in mind. One of our goals was to simplify the scientific discussion surrounding Pluto’s planetary status into language the general public could understand. Think school children curious what a dwarf planet is or millennials like myself who remember growing up with nine planets and then suddenly there were only eight. The website needed to be simple, easy to navigate, and boil down a century of scientific discoveries and debate into an easily digestible package with the goal of changing the hearts and minds of the public for little Pluto’s sake.

                            Because this was just a class project, we never really intended to get the shop up and running. It was effectively a placeholder for what could have been. There was also a surprising lack of content. Despite over a century of history being covered, Pluto’s story is shockingly brief. We had to have five pages as per the requirements of the project, but realistically, the History and Controversies pages could have been combined. Quite frankly, the whole site could have been a single page with a link to an external shop, if that were made.

                            The project was to make an advocacy website. Our cause: make Pluto a planet again. Why? Nostalgia and longing for the halcyon days when there were nine planets in the solar system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was decided that we would build an informational website to teach visitors about Pluto, why it was demoted to dwarf planet status, the resulting debate within the scientific community, and hopefully convince them to sign a petition to reverse the decision.
                        </p>

                            Five pages were needed as per the project requirements, so we settled on Home, History, Controversies, Join Us, and a Shop. I sketched the desktop and mobile versions of each page and mapped out how they would link to each other.

                        <p>
                            Later, I would make the high-fidelity click-through prototype in Adobe XD. This gave us an opportunity to adjust color and font choices. For this project, the most testing we did was me showing the prototype to the team and asking for feedback. They liked it, so we moved onto development.

                            It was at this point when we realized the shop probably wasn’t happening, but we chose to include a non-functional version in the final project anyway. We weren’t being graded on whether or not we could fulfill a custom t-shirt order, after all.

                            Unfortunately, development hit a bit of a snag the day before our third milestone, the develop phase, was due. What I can only describe as communication issues led Bert to lay out the site with Webflow’s drag and drop interface, leading to an unresponsive website with a rat’s nest of CSS classes with manual positioning on everything. It’s a shame he didn’t reach out for help with the CSS, because I had to redo most of the development in little more than a day to get it in on-time. Talk about crunch!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Leading up to milestone four, deployment, I spent time adding content and adjusting pages to look closer to the XD prototypes. By the end, I was proud of the final product.

                            I learned quite a bit of tricks to bend the HTML to my will with some funky CSS, like using a background image for the custom bullet points on the Controversies page so that it lined up the way I wanted. If I had more time, I might have implemented a proper grid for layout instead of eyeballing it with margins and padding. I was very pleased with the timeline on the history page. I managed to make it look almost exactly like the mockups. The only thing missing was having it collapse and expand each event. I just didn’t have time to make it more interactive.

                            Looking back, it might have been better to pick a different topic. The five-page requirement coupled with the lack of content surrounding Pluto’s planethood left us with five pages of not a whole lot. However, there was no way we could have seen this problem coming without having done all the research on the topic. Our peers chose more serious advocacy problems, like animal protection and waste management – topics with significantly more content to talk about.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Communication issues also held us back. There was confusion about the difference between the style guide and visual design guide that led to one designer doing both and sort of stepping on the other’s toes, so to speak. There was also the issue with development that led to me doing most of it last minute. Better communication would have saved us all a lot of headache.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Despite the issues, I’m proud of the final product, and I’m happy to feature it in my portfolio because the process was a valuable learning experience.
